      "text": "Update the global page background styling to be more colorful by replacing the current subtle background gradient (used on the main app container and loading screen) with a richer multi-stop gradient that incorporates existing theme colors (e.g., primary/secondary/accent) while maintaining readable contrast for all foreground text in both light and dark modes.",

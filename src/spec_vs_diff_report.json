  "summary": "Implemented a new always-visible \"Live Status\" entry point in the main tab UI, added a Go Live help card adjacent to Live App Status, and updated LivePublishStatus to show/copy the current site origin and a derived public ic0.app link (when resolvable) using English toasts. Also added utility helpers for origin, canister-id resolution, public link generation, and clipboard copy.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "If the canister ID is not available, the UI shows an English “Not available” (or equivalent) state for the public ICP link (and does not crash).",
      "reason": "The diff shows defensive null handling in copy action (toast error when link is missing) and link derivation returning null, but the truncated LivePublishStatus snippet does not explicitly show the rendered \"Not available\" UI state for the Public ICP Link field.",

  "summary": "The diff does not provide evidence that the REQ-12 admin-only build/deploy metadata update method (and related behavior) was implemented in backend/main.mo. Additionally, project_state.json was modified even though the request was strictly about backend behavior and imposed constraints around frontend-only files (not mentioning project_state.json).",

    {
      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "backend/main.mo exposes a new shared admin-only method that updates canisterBuildMetadata (commitHash, buildTime, dfxVersion), traps with an English \"Unauthorized\" message for non-admins, and preserves getCanisterBuildMetadata as a public query returning sensible defaults with no candid/type mismatch for existing frontend query useGetCanisterBuildMetadata.",
      "reason": "The provided backend/main.mo diff snippet is truncated and contains only imports/type definitions; it does not show any new shared update method, authorization check/trap message, canisterBuildMetadata storage, or getCanisterBuildMetadata behavior/return defaults. Therefore the requirement cannot be verified as implemented from the diff evidence.",

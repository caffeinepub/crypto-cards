  "summary": "Diff adds Spades multi-hand scoring utilities (target=500, hand scoring, winner determination), extends Spades state to track persistent totalScore/handNumber, and updates the Spades engine/UI to support a 500-point target flow. Due to truncation of key modified files, some acceptance-criteria behaviors (auto-starting new hands and game-over gating) cannot be fully verified from provided evidence.",

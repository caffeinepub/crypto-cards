  "summary": "The diff primarily adds frontend UI/utilities to display a “Live Deployment Status” section (including generation/copying of an ic0.app link and refetching build metadata). It does not contain evidence of actually publishing/deploying Version 163 to the Live (public) canister.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Publish/deploy the current draft build (Version 163) to the Live (public) canister so the application is accessible via the public ICP gateway URL (https://<canister-id>.ic0.app), not only via the draft/preview origin.",
      "reason": "No deployment/publish mechanism or configuration change is shown in the diff; backend file even indicates no code changes are needed and suggests manual deployment. The changes are limited to UI/status display and link generation utilities, which do not perform a publish to the live canister.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo",
        "frontend/src/components/AdminSettings.tsx",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added new Admin Settings UI sections/components for live publish verification (LivePublishStatus, GoLiveHelp) rather than only performing a publish/deploy action.",
      "reason": "REQ-1 is about publishing/deploying Version 163 to the live canister; the diff implements new UI for status/verification instead of (or in addition to) deployment. This is not explicitly requested and risks being considered new UI scope.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/AdminSettings.tsx",
        "frontend/src/components/LivePublishStatus.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Introduced new ICP link utility helpers to infer canister ID from hostname/storage/env and generate a public ic0.app link, plus clipboard helper.",
      "reason": "Not requested explicitly; REQ-1 only requires the Public ICP Link be available and correct after publish, not the addition of heuristic canister-id resolution logic.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/utils/icpLinks.ts"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Broader unrelated frontend feature additions/changes (wallet manager/provider, header/footer changes, lobby/tournament placeholders, styling changes, playable game UI, etc.).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest Non-goals explicitly say not to add new gameplay, wallet, admin, or UI features as part of this request; the diff summary indicates multiple such changes.",

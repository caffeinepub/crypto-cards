  "summary": "Frontend changes implement improved backend connectivity UI/state handling via useActorWithRetry and BackendConnectivityIndicator, and adjust useQueries to avoid calling a non-existent profile-save method. However, no backend changes are shown for the required candid/API fix and build metadata stability requirements.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Backend exposes a public method named saveUserProfile (or frontend no longer calls saveUserProfile) and the save-profile flow succeeds end-to-end (saving updates canister state and getCallerUserProfile returns the saved value), with successful candid/type generation.",
      "reason": "The diff shows a frontend-side change (per summary) to call a different backend method, but there is no evidence in the provided modified files that the backend candid/API now includes the required profile-save method or that canister state update + subsequent readback is implemented/fixed.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts (truncated)",
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (truncated)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "backend/main.mo getCanisterBuildMetadata always returns a valid CanisterBuildMetadata record (never traps) and returns safe defaults (empty strings, buildTime=0) when unset.",
      "reason": "No backend files (e.g., backend/main.mo) are included in the modified file list or shown with changes; therefore there is no evidence that getCanisterBuildMetadata was made stable or defaulted.",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary (Modified FILES list shows no backend/main.mo)"
